      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
    <p> My earliest memories all revolve around me standing in front of a chalkboard lecturing to a sea of my stuffed animals. Whether it was a lesson on counting by 10 or a step by step process on convincing my parents to take me out to ice cream, I loved the feeling of sharing my knowledge with others, even if the audience wasn’t real. I realized that by teaching, I was also learning, not only about the content but also about myself and how to interact with others, which eventually blossomed into a lifelong passion for education.

    <p>While my career trajectory has shifted since then, my consistent commitment to the field of education led me down a new path that also works to enhance how users, as unique individuals, interact with the world. Through my make-believe encounters as a teacher, I found that the most important part of the job is tailoring the learning experience to each student; everyone’s style of learning and living is individual to them. As a designer, this has helped me empathize with users on a whole new level, ensuring that my designs are impactful and accessible to every single person who may come across them. On this journey, I hope to contribute to the bridge between technology and education, in and out of the classroom, and empower a new generation of young minds.
