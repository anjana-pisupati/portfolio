      <p>During the University of Michiganâ€™s COVID-19 Campus Challenge, my team created and pitched a solution to combat food insecurity as the school began its public health informed semester. The photos below are from a prototype I created using Figma, demonstrating how our solution works.

    <h1>RiskSniper</h1>
    <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic coming to the United States and me being away from home at school, my mom has been so worried. Reading about rumors of cases on Facebook groups, running to four different grocery stores to find toilet paper, and worrying about her family members around the world have been filling up her time with constant anxiety.  After talking to my friends and seeing posts on social media, I realized that this feeling was not unique to my family. The uncertainty of this pandemic has taken a toll on many people, and since it is so new, there are no tools to help cope with it. 

      When disasters hit, users need an effective platform that filters out the mass hysteria and delivers only relevant, useful information all in the same place.
